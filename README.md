# api_server_simulator_ui
UI for api_server_simulator (https://github.com/developer-kikikaikai/api_server_simulator)

There are some problems at api_server_simulator

1. It's a simple service for REST (or some) API simuration. So there is no easy command to import any simuration datas.
2. A POST body response has to set \ before a " in simurated response body json data. It's very Troublesome  

=> I want to create a POST body generator.
